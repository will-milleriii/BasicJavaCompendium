The Focus of this Project is to provide a central location to study basic Java Data Structures and Algorithms.

1. Data Structures
    - File currently contains the basic Java Structures you will see in the Java Language.
    
2. Linked Lists
    - File currently contains basic Linked List examples
    
3. Common Searching Algorithms
    - File currently contains the most common Searching Algorithms found in Java Development.
    
4. TO BE CONTINUED
    - In the future the goal is to add SORTING ALGOS, SEARCH TREES, more complex DATA STRUCTURES, and GRAPHING
    
-   How to use this File:
    -   Follow TDD to write tests that prove these algorithms true/false
    -   Pass in different values into the different lists, arrays, or algorithms to better understand these functions
